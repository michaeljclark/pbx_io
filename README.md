# sushi

Xcode, Visual Studio (and eventually) Ninja project generator

Work in progress...

## Status

* Generates Xcode and Visual Studio project files
* Established initial file format for maki file (.sushi project file)
* ```sushi.xcodeproj``` and ```sushi.vsproj``` are generated by ```maki```

## To do

* Implement conditional blocks
* Implement cross-project dependencies
* Implement network dependency resolution (github)
* Seed sushi ports repository with commonly used packages
* ...

## Building

* Tested with GCC 4.9, Clang 3.3 and MSC v110 (Visual Studio 2012)
* Builds on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD with  gmake and GCC 4.9
* Builds on Windows using Visual Studio 2012, 2013 or 2015
* Builds on OS X using Xcode or gmake (default make on OS X)
* Will be more useful when Ninja support is added
